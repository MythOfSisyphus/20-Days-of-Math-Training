#### Problem 1
>The positive integers are colored black and white. The sum of two differently colored numbers is black, and their product is white. What is the product to white numbers? Find all such colorings.

---
#### Problem 2
> (Canada $1969$) Let $\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3,...\}$ denote the set of positive integers. Find all functions $f:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $m, n \in \mathbb{N}: f(2) = 2, f(mn) = f(m) f(n)$ and $f(n+1) > f(n).$

#### Problem 3
>(Balkan Mathematical Olympiad $1998$) Prove that there are no integers $x$ and $y$ satisfying $x^2 = y^5 - 4$.

---
#### Problem 4
>Let $k$ be an integer greater than 1. Suppose that $a_0 > 0$ and define $$a_{n+1} = a_n + \frac{1}{\sqrt[k]{a_n}}$$ for $n > 0.$ Evaluate $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_n^{k+1}}{n^k}$$
