## Insight of The Day
I have selected two problems for today. Let's see how to approach them and get some insight.

---
### Problem 1
#### Find all positive integers $n$ such that $5^n > n!.$ 

#### My attempt:

### Problem 2
#### Let $\varphi_0(x) = \ln(x),$ and let $\varphi_n(x) = \int_0^x \varphi_{n-1}(t) dt$ for $n \geq t.$
1. Find the closed formula for $\varphi_n(x).$
2. Find the limit $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n! \cdot \varphi_n(1)}{\ln(x)}$$
#### My attempt:
